# Cardano Node Install

This project aims to provide helper scripts for installing and running Cardano Node on a Linux machine for the Preview Testnet Environment.

The scripts are based on the Official Cocs available on the [Cardano Developers Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/installing-cardano-node)

Running the following command will download and create individual script files on your local file system, which you will then be required to run yourself:

`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wowica/cardano-node-install/main/setup.sh | bash -`

Running the command above will NOT run any of the scripts.
