# Cardano Node Install

This project aims to provide helper scripts for installing and running a Cardano Relay Node on a Linux machine for the **Preview Testnet** Environment. It has been tested on an **Ubuntu Server 22.04** with Cardano Node version **8.1.1** with PSP disabled.

The scripts are based on the Official Documentation available on the [Cardano Developers Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/installing-cardano-node)

## Installing

Clone this repo or run the script below to download the script files to your local file system.

`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wowica/cardano-node-install/main/scripts/setup.sh | bash -`

Running the command above will strictly download the scripts. It will NOT execute them. You are required to do this yourself.
